# Cybersecurity Exercises

## Overview
This repository contains three distinct folders, each designed to showcase different aspects of Cybersecurity such offensive security, offensive tools, and penetration testing. Each exercise displays completed exercises and results for viewing, providing insights into network security, system vulnerabilities, and ethical hacking techniques. The exercises were completed using the Kali Linux Virtual Machine through VMWare Fusion.

## Features
- **Offensive Security**: Demonstrates the use of networking commands, basic nmap scanning techniques, and proper output management.
- **Offensive Tools**: Demonstrates the application of tools like `whois`, `host`, `dig`, `dirbuster`, and `nikto` to explore DNS configurations, WHOIS data, and web security vulnerabilities.
- **Penetration Testing**: Demonstrates active network scanning procedures, TCP and UDP port scans, and the use of OpenVAS/GVM for conducting vulnerability assessments on predetermined IP ranges.

## Usage
- Navigate to the respective folder.
- Store all outputs and logs in the predefined files and directories as instructed.
- Outputs and logs are saved as files and documents for review.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of network protocols, Linux, and cybersecurity concepts.
- Understanding of the tools and technologies used, such as Kali Linux, VMware Fusion, and various cybersecurity tools mentioned such as OpenVAS/GVM.

## Input
- Preconfigured commands and parameters for educational purposes.
- Fixed datasets including network IP addresses and domain information used during the exercises.

## Output
- Stored log files and output texts, such as `nmap1.txt`, `whois_pub_ip.txt`, and `dirbuster.txt`, which are available for review.
- PDF reports from GVM scans, detailing the vulnerabilities found across various network setups.

## Notes
- IP address `.14` is intentionally skipped and non-operational.
- This repository is for review and not active project execution.
